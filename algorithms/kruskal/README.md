# Kruskal's Algorithm

Kruskal's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for a weighted undirected graph. This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized.

## How to use

The `run_algorithm` function in `kruskal.py` can be used to run Kruskal's Algorithm on a given graph. It returns the edges in the MST, the total weight of the MST, and the steps for visualization.
